# Kotlin Vulkan

Just some simple Vulkan examples in Kotlin with LWJGL3.
Don't expect anything fancy, just some basic examples to get started as a private project for learning Vulkan.
Don't know where this is going yet.

**Why no existing engine?**

*Short answer:*\
Because learning by doing is the best way to understand how things work, and I want to learn things!

*Long answer:*\
Who needs those fancy pre-built engines when you can spend countless hours debugging memory leaks and questioning your
life choices?
It's like choosing to build a car from scratch instead of buying one, probably a bit crazy, but hey, at least you'll
know exactly why everything breaks!
Plus, there's something magical about the moment when your first triangle finally appears on screen after days
of wrestling with Vulkan boilerplate code.
No existing engine can give you that kind of satisfaction (or frustration).

> **Disclaimer**: This is a hobby project. Expect bugs. Expect weird design decisions.
> Also expect random refactors at 3AM.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

on Linux or

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

on Windows.
Requires JDK 21 to be installed, nothing else.

## Running

Examples are located in the `anvil-examples` module.

      ([anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/Triangle2D.kt](./anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/Triangle2D.kt)):
      after following article
      [Vertex Buffer creation](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Vertex_buffer_creation)
      ```bash
      ./gradlew run -PmainClass=dev.cryptospace.anvil.app.Triangle2DKt
      ```
    - Colored Quad
      ([anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/ColoredQuad2D.kt](./anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/ColoredQuad2D.kt)):
      after following article
      [Index buffer](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Index_buffer)
      ```bash
      ./gradlew run -PmainClass=dev.cryptospace.anvil.app.ColoredQuad2DKt
      ```
    - Rotating Quad
      ([anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/RotatingQuad3D.kt](./anvil-examples/src/main/kotlin/dev/cryptospace/anvil/app/RotatingQuad3D.kt)):
      after following article
      [Descriptor pool and sets](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Uniform_buffers/Descriptor_pool_and_sets)
      ```bash

      ```

Supports the following CLI properties (must be set in the file `build.gradle.kts` in the `anvil-examples` directory)

```bash
-Duse-x11 # Use X11 instead of Wayland, only works on Linux in a Wayland session. Otherwise ignored.
-Duse-validation-layers # Enable Vulkan validation layers for debugging. Not recommended for performance. Requires Vulkan SDK to be installed.
```
