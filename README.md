# Kotlin Vulkan [![Build](https://github.com/nimueller/kotlin-vulkan/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nimueller/kotlin-vulkan/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=nimueller_kotlin-vulkan&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=nimueller_kotlin-vulkan)

Just some simple Vulkan examples in Kotlin with LWJGL3.
Don't expect anything fancy, just some basic examples to get started as a private project for learning Vulkan.
Don't know where this is going yet.

**Why no existing engine?**

*Short answer:*\
Because learning by doing is the best way to understand how things work, and I want to learn things!

*Long answer:*\
Who needs those fancy pre-built engines when you can spend countless hours debugging memory leaks and questioning your
life choices?
It's like choosing to build a car from scratch instead of buying one, probably a bit crazy, but hey, at least you'll
know exactly why everything breaks!
Plus, there's something magical about the moment when your first triangle finally appears on screen after days
of wrestling with Vulkan boilerplate code.
No existing engine can give you that kind of satisfaction (or frustration).

**Why Kotlin?**

Just have a look at this:

```kotlin
val pipelineTextured3DLayout =
    PipelineLayoutBuilder(logicalDevice = deviceManager.logicalDevice).apply {
        pushConstant(EnumSet.of(ShaderStage.VERTEX), Mat4)
        pushConstant(EnumSet.of(ShaderStage.FRAGMENT), NativeTypeLayout.FLOAT)
        descriptorSetLayouts.add(frameDescriptorSetLayout)
        descriptorSetLayouts.add(textureDescriptorSetLayout)
    }.build()

val pipelineTextured3D: Pipeline =
    PipelineBuilder(
        logicalDevice = deviceManager.logicalDevice,
        renderPass = renderPass,
        pipelineLayout = pipelineTextured3DLayout,
    ).apply {
        vertexLayout = TexturedVertex3
        shaderModules[ShaderStage.VERTEX] = ShaderModule(deviceManager.logicalDevice, "/shaders/vert.spv")
        shaderModules[ShaderStage.FRAGMENT] = ShaderModule(deviceManager.logicalDevice, "/shaders/frag.spv")
    }.build()
```

Have you ever seen such a simple Vulkan pipeline creation?
It is just awesome.
